I have created a complete Python application with a colourful calculator-style GUI that allows you to convert text to Morse code. Here are the main features:

Large and colourful graphical interface:

800x600 pixel window size
Dark blue colour theme with coloured calculator-style buttons
Well-organised layout with clearly separated input and output areas


Text-Morse conversion functionality:

Supports common letters, numbers and punctuation marks
Displays converted Morse code in a dedicated area


Audio playback:

Plays Morse code sounds (dots and dashes)
Respects correct pauses between symbols, letters and words
Uses pygame for sound generation


Function buttons:

‘Convert’ (green): converts text into Morse code
‘Play Sound’ (blue): plays Morse code as audio
‘Clear’ (red): cleans input and output fields



To run this programme, you will need Python with the tkinter and pygame libraries installed. The programme has been designed to be easy to use and visually appealing, suitable for those new to the world of programming with the help of AI.

For a more advanced study, the advice is to interpret the code also by going on the web, literally ‘disassembling’ the code by taking it in blocks starting from practice with the help of a Phyton programming book for school use and for fun
